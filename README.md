# ElectronicSpeedController
## Bachelor thesis
We are three guys from NTNU working on a project to make a ESC.
We will over the first semester of 2022 make our own changes to a exising shamtic for a pcb design.
## Main areas of our bahcelor:
### PCB redesign
-We will redesign existing PCB design to fit new motor
-Make som changes to the schematic to improve the system
### Communication 
-Deside if we are going to use CANBUS, PWM or other communication to controll the motor
### Power
-We need to use slip-rings to get DC-power to the system
-Make a testbench for slip-ring desing to test that it works properly
-Get the motors mountet to the slip-ring
